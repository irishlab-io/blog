# Dotfiles

This is my blog, it's been a project of myself to write my own for a while.  This is a place where I can write things of my own.

I plan to write here whenever I have time and feels it make sense.  I have a little backlog of idea and will see how these goes.

## Test

{{< github-content
    repo="irish1986/dotfiles"
    path="main.yml"
    lang="yaml" >}}
