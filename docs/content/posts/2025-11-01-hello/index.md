This is my blog, it's been a project of myself to write my own for a while.  This is a place where I can write things of my own.

I plan to write here whenever I have time and feels it make sense.  I have a little backlog of idea and will see how these goes.

## What I am writing about

Pretty easy:

- Dev(Sec)Ops
- Homelab
- Server and Infrastructures
- Application Security
- Cybersecurity
- Whatever I feels like

## Who am I

I am from Montréal (Canada) working in the Financial industry as an DevSecOps & Application Security Senior Advisor.  Mostly working to improve DevSecOps and Security practices in a large scale organization.
